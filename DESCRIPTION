Description: Allows wrapping values in `success()` and `failure()` types to capture 
    the result of operations, along with any status codes. Risky expressions can be 
    wrapped in `as_result()` and functions wrapped in `result()` to catch errors
    and assign the relevant result types. Monadic result objects can be bound together 
    in chains to gracefully handle errors in pipelines or transaction scripts.
